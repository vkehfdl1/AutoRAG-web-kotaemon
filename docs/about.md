# About AutoRAG

An open source AutoML tool for RAG.
The difference between AutoRAG and other RAG frameworks is that AutoRAG is designed to find the optimal RAG pipeline.
Frameworks are like a lego itself, but AutoRAG is the builder of lego automatically.
All you need to do is prepare your own dataset, and even AutoRAG can help that.

Built for both RAG developers and people who don't know about RAG well, but want to use LLM with their own documents.
